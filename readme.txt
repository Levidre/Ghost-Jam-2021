--Readme--

If you're using Mery and Lili as template, you will have to write your own readme here. It's basically just a description of your ghost, its features and how to use it.

Mery and Lili and two androids talking about dev stuff. They wilk describe some ghost coding shenanigans, some tricks and some things ghost devs can do with their ghost.
They would talk about anything and mostly about advanced stuff as, for example, some animations tricks, ghost communication and SAORI.

They are having the usual ghosts features, so opening the calendar, checking the emails and emptying the recycle bin.
They have useful functions in plus though. They have a synchronous talk function, a system to keep them to be interrupted by other ghost communications and a basic relationship system implemented but not really used. The bases of ghost communication are implemented.

They would talk by pressing t and repeat what they said with r.
