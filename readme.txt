----------Among Us Crewmate-----------

This ghost is a depiction of the crewmate (bean?) from Among Us, created during the Ghost Jam of April 2021 by Levidre, ScardyFluff, and EchoStarling!

Crewmate can do most standard ghost functions such as emptying your recycling bin, checking the calendar, and checking your system status!

They also have a relationship system that will keep track of how you treat them, be it well or terribly. And, well, they might have some secrets of their own..?

Move your mouse on the crewmate's head to pet them. Double-clicking on their head or face will punch them. Double-clicking on their body brings up their menu.

'T' - Just talking.
'R' - Repeating dialogue. 
F1 - Brings up this readme.

Did I forget to mention that the crewmate changes colors? Crewmate disco ball!

Nah, I'm kidding on that one, but if you will, you can enable a setting so the crewmate changes colors daily.
