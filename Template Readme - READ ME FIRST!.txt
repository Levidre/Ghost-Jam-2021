------------Mery and Lili template----------

This ghost is an advanced template. It's having some useful functions for you to use in your own ghost.

It has been made from the Girl and Triangle template, that is Zarla's and that can be found with her tutorial here : http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html

Some of Zarla's comments have been kept because they are just perfect for coders in learning so there will be written who wrote which comments.
However you can start to work on your ghost wherever you want, you will be a lot less guided and there are less explainations. Most anecdotes and information will be said by the ghost itself to have less comments in the code. 

I recommend too to use Notepad++ for editing your ghost files.


Zarla's website is http://www.ashido.com, you can find her at zarla.livejournal.com, zarla.dreamwidth.org, or at zarla-s.tumblr.com.

The basic coding of Girl and Trianle was based on a ghost of cindysuke, whose deviantart is cindysuke.deviantart.com. This template keeps the same structure.


If you're using Mery and Lili as template, it would be nice to keep a link to one of Zarla's websites as her tumblr, deviantart, lj, etc since she appreciates when ghosts made from Girl and Triangle have a link to her. I would appreciate a link to one of my websites too. I have a personnal website, a tumblr and a deviantart. Or if you prefer, instead of one of my websites, you can put a link to the Ukagaka Dream Team webring.
