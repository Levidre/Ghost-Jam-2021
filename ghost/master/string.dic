//---------------------------Strings--------------------------
//Zarla : 
//As you can see above, this file was written by umeici, but unfortunately the rest of the text up there got a bit garbled at some point. I'll leave it though.

//Anyway, string.dic has to do with the right-click SSP menu, specifically the captions for the menu options. This is VERY IMPORTANT if you're going to set up the Network Update for your ghost! Otherwise this is just an easy place to customize your ghost's menu to your tastes. 

//If you're going to set up Network Update, make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details! I won't get into the whole thing here, but this page has a very important value you will need to change for Network Update to work!
//Note also here that lines do not end with \e here. This is because the ghost isn't speaking these lines, they're just being used in the code.


//---- Username -----------------------------------------------------------------------
//Don't touch this.

//---- Network Update URL ----------------------------------------------
//Zarla : This is the URL where your ghost will look for updates. If you're setting up Network Updates YOU MUST change this to point at the right directory! Otherwise your ghost will not update properly! If you're not going to use the Network Update feature, just leave this section as it is or delete it, it should be fine.

//---- Top Menu Option Caption -----------------------------------------
//Zarla : You may have noticed that there are two collapsed links at the top of the SSP right click menu that lead you to another assortment of links. This is the caption for the top option of the menu.

	"%ASC(13)Reference Sites"

//---- Top Menu Option Websites -----------------------------------------------------
//Zarla : These are the websites listed under that button we just named up there. You can put whatever sites you want in here. I'll actually link to some real sites here to be helpful. Feel free to replace these with the sites you like instead. Pay close attention to the formatting that follows!

	//Zarla : This first line is the name that will display in the menu for your site. In this case, it would display "Ghost Template Walkthrough".
	"%ASC(1)https://ukagakadreamteam.tumblr.com/%ASC(2)"

	//Zarla : And this is the site that it would link to. Note that a website address begins with %ASC(1) and ends with %ASC(2). Don't forget these!

//---- The second option from the top's caption -----------------------------------------
//Zarla : This is the name of the second option in that list. You can change this to whatever you want, or even put in multiple names. If you do more than one, the names will switch randomly.

 //---- Websites in the Second Option --------------------------------------------------
 //Zarla : These are the websites listed under that second button we just named up there. Like with the other option, these are the websites you want to link to. You can put whatever sites you want in here. Pay close attention to the formatting that follows!
 
On_sakura.portalsites //Echo: Of course, these websites won't be shown together. They'll be scrambled and chosen at random by the code I think.
